# rhyme-word-info

This assignment is similar to rhyme-search but has different functionality, this assignment also uses the RhymeBrain API (https://rhymebrain.com/api.html).
The user can enter a query and the first 10 rhymes along with the 'Word Information' (see the "Word Information" section of the API documentation).
